    <p>
      I am Neda Mousavi, a Business Intelligence Analyst in the Department of Data and Measurement at Havas Media, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.
    </p>

    <p>
  I hold two Ph.D. degrees, in Speech Science and in Linguistics. My Ph.D. in Speech Science was carried out across two institutions, beginning at Goethe University Frankfurt am Main, and completed at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Germany (2025). My Ph.D. in Linguistics was completed at Allameh Tabataba’i University in Tehran, Iran (2013). My academic background also includes a Master’s degree in Linguistics from Bu-Ali Sina University in Hamadan, Iran (2008), and a Bachelor’s degree in Physics from the University of Isfahan, Iran (2006).
    </p>

    <p>
      I have also held professional positions in both academic and industry settings. Prior to my current role at Havas Media, I was a Guest Scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics in Frankfurt (2024–2025). I have also had a position as a Research Associate at the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (2023–2025), and earlier as a Research and Teaching Assistant at Goethe University Frankfurt (2020–2022). Before moving to Germany, I held academic positions in Iran, including Assistant Professor and Deputy of the Department of Linguistics at the University of Isfahan, as well as an Assistant Professor position at the Iranian Research Institute for Information Science and Technology (IRANDOC). Earlier in my career, I worked as a computational linguistics researcher on Persian text-to-speech systems at ASR Gooyesh Pardaz Company, in collaboration with Sharif University of Technology.
