            I am Neda Mousavi, a Business Intelligence Analyst at Havas Media in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, with a diverse background spanning both professional and academic work.
          </p>

          <p>
            Academically, I hold two Ph.D. degrees. My second Ph.D. was in speech science and was conducted across two institutions: I began my doctoral studies in Phonetics at Goethe University Frankfurt am Main, Germany (2019–2022), and continued and completed the degree in Speech Science at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Germany (2022–2025), following my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Sven Grawunder. I previously earned a Ph.D. in Linguistics from Allameh Tabataba’i University in Tehran, Iran (2009–2013), under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Omid Tabibzadeh and Prof. Dr. Golnaz Modarresi. My academic background also includes a Master’s degree in Linguistics from Bu-Ali Sina University in Hamadan, Iran (2006–2008), supervised by Prof. Dr. Omid Tabibzadeh and Prof. Dr. Moharram Eslami, and a Bachelor’s degree in Physics from the University of Isfahan, Iran (2001–2006).
          </p>

          <p>
          Professionally, I have worked across both academic and industry settings. Since 2025, I have been working as a Business Intelligence Analyst at Havas Media in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Prior to this, I was a Guest Scientist in the group of Pauline Larrouy-Maestri at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics in Frankfurt (2024–2025). I have also worked as a Research Associate in the group of Prof. Dr. Sven Grawunder at the Institute for Music, Media and Speech Science, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (2023–2025), and earlier as a Research and Teaching Assistant in the same group at Goethe University Frankfurt (2020–2022). Before moving to Germany, I held academic positions in Iran, including Assistant Professor roles at the University of Isfahan and at the Iranian Research Institute for Information Science and Technology (IRANDOC). Earlier in my career, I worked as a computational linguistics researcher on Persian text-to-speech systems at ASR Gooyesh Pardaz Company, in collaboration with Sharif University of Technology.
