        I am Neda Mousavi, a BI Analyst at Havas Media, with a diverse background spanning both professional and academic work.
        Academically, I hold two Ph.D. degrees. My second Ph.D. was in speech science and phonetics and was conducted across two institutions: I began my doctoral studies in Phonetics at Goethe University Frankfurt (2019–2022) and continued and completed the degree in Speech Science at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (2022–2025), following my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Sven Grawunder. I previously earned a Ph.D. in Linguistics from Allameh Tabataba’i University in Tehran (2009–2013), under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Omid Tabibzadeh and Prof. Dr. Golnaz Modarresi. My academic background also includes a Master’s degree in Linguistics from Bu-Ali Sina University in Hamadan (2006–2008), supervised by Prof. Dr. Omid Tabibzadeh and Prof. Dr. Moharram Eslami, and a Bachelor’s degree in Physics from the University of Isfahan (2001–2006).
