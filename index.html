    I am Neda Mousavi, a Business Intelligence Analyst at Havas Media in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, with a diverse background that encompasses both professional and academic work.
  </p>

  <p>
    Academically, I hold two Ph.D. degrees. My second Ph.D. was in speech science and phonetics and was conducted across two institutions: I began my doctoral studies in Phonetics at Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany (2019–2022), and continued and completed the degree in Speech Science at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Germany (2022–2025), following my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Sven Grawunder. I previously earned a Ph.D. in Linguistics from Allameh Tabataba’i University in Tehran, Iran (2009–2013), under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Omid Tabibzadeh and Prof. Dr. Golnaz Modarresi. My academic background also includes a Master’s degree in Linguistics from Bu-Ali Sina University in Hamadan, Iran (2006–2008), supervised by Prof. Dr. Omid Tabibzadeh and Prof. Dr. Moharram Eslami, and a Bachelor’s degree in Physics from the University of Isfahan, Iran (2001–2006).
